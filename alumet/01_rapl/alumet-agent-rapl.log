[2025-11-25T11:36:45Z ERROR plugin_rapl::powercap] I could not use the powercap sysfs to read RAPL energy counters: Could not open /sys/devices/virtual/powercap/intel-rapl/intel-rapl:0/energy_uj. Try to adjust file permissions..
    This is probably caused by insufficient privileges.
    Please check that you have read access to everything in '/sys/devices/virtual/powercap/intel-rapl'.
    
    A solution could be:
        sudo chmod a+r -R /sys/devices/virtual/powercap/intel-rapl
Error: startup failure

Caused by:
